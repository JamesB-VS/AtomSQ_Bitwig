# V1.1
    
## New Stuff:
1. Added new "empty" device logic so that if there is no device in the selected track, all buttons bring up the device browser. 
2. Reworked the popup-browser. Controls for all insert types (Devices, Presets, Samples etc) have been updated. See manual for details.

   
## Fixes:
 1. Remote Controls for a device are no longer tied to the 1st page of RCs. They follow whatever is on screen.
 2. Move Device display buttons now light up properly, if that action is possible.
 3. Resolved "bouncing" issues for moving devices at the start and end of a device chain.
