Track: delete in page 2 shows the toggle light from Arm on page one. 

browser shows Preset also for new devices.....should fix.
does preview also work for devices, like presets? if not, should remove button in that context.
in the preset context, there is no actual reason for Enc 5 to do something, but it is still bound to catagory. this allows an "escape" from the expected functionality, which should be fixed.
Preset also opens the new device menu if no device is present. Feature?

could add device type and folders to Enc 3-4 for preset browsing. when adding a new device, this would be cool.
